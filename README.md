# Hi!

Thank you for taking the time to check this out, it is much appreciated!

## Usage:
I'm hoping you shouldn't find this too tricky. Firstly you need to have Lua installed to actually run the program.

Listed below is how to install Lua on each OS (via the command line).

### Windows

winget install Lua.Lua

### Linux

Debian/Ubuntu based distros: sudo apt install lua5.4

Fedora: sudo dnf install lua

Arch based distros:  sudo pacman -S lua

### Mac OS

brew install lua

----------

Clone this repo with **git clone https://github.com/Spectrum0-0/CurConverter** (git must be installed).

Via the command line, change in to the 'CurConverter' directory by using **cd**.

Add the files to convert in to the 'toConvert' directory.

Then run the script in the terminal with **lua main.lua**

If you are on Mac or Linux, you may need to run **chmod +x main.lua** first before you can execute the file.
